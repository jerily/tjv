Add ability to define a callback procedure for validation. It can be -command option
    for the type string, or special type "command".

Add ability to define json array without validation. Currently, json array can be defined
    with -items option. However, this option does not allow empty schema definition.

Check failed tests for all validateType*.test files.

Add tests to outcome.test to get each type in Tcl and Json formats.

ajv allows to specify 2 checks for string format. The first check is very simple and
   basic pattern. It should be executed fast. If it fails, a more complex regexp
   will be used, which will take longer to execute. This maximizes performance for
   simple cases by using lightweight regexps first. This feature should be added
   to tjv.
